# Benefits and Harms of ADHD Interventions: Umbrella Review and Platform for Shared Decision-Making

## Overview

This repository contains data, analysis, and documentation for an umbrella review examining the benefits and harms of interventions for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project aims to synthesize evidence from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses to provide a comprehensive overview of ADHD intervention effectiveness and safety.

The findings are intended to support a platform for shared decision-making between healthcare providers, people with lived experience of ADHD, caregivers, and clinical guidelines developers.
